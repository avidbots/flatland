Welcome to Flatland's API documentation!
==========================================
Flatland is a performance centric 2D robot simulator started at Avidbots Corp.. 
It is intended for use as a light weight alternative to Gazebo Simulator for 
ground robots on flat ground. Flatland uses Box2D for physics simulation and 
it is built to integrate directly with ROS. Flatland loads its simulation 
environment from YAML files and provide a plugin system for extending its 
functionalities.

This read-the-docs contains documentation for the classes in Flatland.

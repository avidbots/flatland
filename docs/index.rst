Welcome to Flatland's documentation!
====================================
Flatland is a performance centric 2D robot simulator started at Avidbots Corp.. 
It is intended for use as a light weight alternative to Gazebo Simulator for 
ground robots on a flat surface. Flatland uses Box2D for physics simulation and 
it is built to integrate directly with ROS. Flatland loads its simulation 
environment from YAML files and provide a plugin system for extending its 
functionalities. 

The code is open source and `available on Github <https://github.com/avidbots/flatland>`_,
BSD3 License.

Class APIs are documented `here <http://flatland-simulator-api.readthedocs.io/>`_.
